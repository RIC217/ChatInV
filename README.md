# ChatInV
Just a little project for me to learning V (using sockets and database)

This is the repository for the server, here is the link for the client :

To launch the server :
```shell
v run main.v
```
To test the register system :
```shell
v run test_register.v
```
To test the login system :
```shell
v run test_login.v
```
