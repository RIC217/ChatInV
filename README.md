# ChatInV
Just a little project for me to learning V (using sockets and database)

This is the repository for the server, here is the link for the client :
https://github.com/RIC217/ChatInV_Client

To launch the server :
```shell
v run Chat_Server.v
```

To launch the server in private mode :
```shell
v Chat_Server.v -d private
```
on Linux and MacOS :
```shell
./Chat_Server
```
on Windows :
```shell
.\Chat_Server.exe
```

To test the register system :
```shell
v run test_register.v
```
To test the login system :

```
